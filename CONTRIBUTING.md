Please provide as much information as possible when reporting a bug or filing an issue on the Windows Subsystem for Linux.
A well written bug will follow the template:

###1) Issue Title

A title succinctly describing the issue. 

####Example

`Traceroute not working.`


###2) Brief description

A brief description of what you are attemping to run.

####Example

`IP_MTU_DISCOVER error when running traceroute.`

###3) Windows version / build number

Your Windows build number.  This can be gathered from the CMD prompt using the `ver` command.

```
C:\>ver 
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.14385] 
``` 

####Example

`Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.14385]`

###4) All commands required to reproduce the error

Should include all packages and environmental variables as well as other required configuration.

####Example

`$ sudo apt-get install traceroute`
`$ traceroute www.microsoft.com`

###5) Copy of the terminal output

####Example

```
russ@RUSSALEX-BOOK:/mnt/c$ traceroute www.microsoft.com
traceroute to www.microsoft.com (23.75.239.28), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets
setsockopt IP_MTU_DISCOVER: Invalid argument
```

###6) Strace of the failing command

Run the failing command under [strace] (http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/wily/man1/strace.1.html).  Normal command structure is:

```                           
$ strace <command> 
```          

Strace can produce a very long output.  If this is more than about 20 lines please paste this into [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) or another paste service and link in the bug.

####Example

```
russ@RUSSALEX-BOOK:/mnt/c$ strace traceroute www.microsoft.com
execve("/usr/bin/traceroute", ["traceroute", "www.microsoft.com"], [/* 22 vars */]) = 0
brk(0)                                  = 0x7fffdd3bc000
access("/etc/ld.so.nohwcap", F_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
mmap(NULL, 8192, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0x7f1f4e820000
access("/etc/ld.so.preload", R_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
...
