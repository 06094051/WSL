# BashOnWindows
This repo is for the reporting of issues found within and when using Bash on Ubuntu on Windows.

Note: If you would like us to consider adding and/or changing features, behaviors, etc., please [post on our UserVoice forum](http://aka.ms/winbashuv). Be sure to search on UserVoice before adding a new ask in order to avoid unnecessarily duplicating the same ask multiple times.

We'll also be posting samples, etc. here so be sure to bookmark and come back regularly!
